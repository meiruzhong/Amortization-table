# Amortization-table
Amortization is a method of repaying a loan through regular payments of interest and principal. 
  ##The size of the loan (the original balance) is reduced by the principal part of the payment. 
  ##The interest part of the payment pays the interest incurred on the remaining principal balance. 
  ##As the principal gets paid down over the term of the loan, the interest part of the payment diminishes.
