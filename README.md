# Amortization-table
Amortization is a method of repaying a loan through regular payments of interest and principal. 
  
  The size of the loan (the original balance) is reduced by the principal part of the payment. 
  
  The interest part of the payment pays the interest incurred on the remaining principal balance. 
  
  As the principal gets paid down over the term of the loan, the interest part of the payment diminishes.
  
Users have to input principal, minimum expected payment, interest, and extra payment. The code contains the error check. If it comes error, users have to re-enter.
